# RailwayTicket-Booking-UserInterface


The main objective of the Railway Ticket Booking UI Design Project is to create an interface that is simple and user-friendly for booking train tickets. This will be achieved by designing a GUI that guides users through the process of selecting their desired train and purchasing tickets. The emphasis will be on creating a seamless and intuitive experience for users, with clear instructions and visual cues to assist them at each stage. Additionally, the project may include integrating the UI with a back-end system for processing and payment. Ultimately, the aim is to create an interface that provides a hassle-free and enjoyable experience for users booking train tickets.
